# Project: Feed Reader Testing

This project was a training exercise in test-driven development.  It entailed writing tests against an existing, fully functional, web-based, RSS feed reader application.  The tests were built with the [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) behavior-driven development framework.

Open index.html in your browser, scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and you will see the test suite section which describes the specs, or tests and their results.  Review feedreader.js to see the tests as they are written, as well as comments describing their purpose.
